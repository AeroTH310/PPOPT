MPO: A Multiparametric Programming and Optimization Package for Python
======================================================================


MPO is a multiparametric programming Solver written in Python, meant for solving general mpQPs and mpLPs with support for mixed integer and Quadratically constrained problems prospectively in the future. Optimized implementations of combinatorial algorithms and graph-based algorithms have been implemented. A focus of this Solver is to implement parallel and scalable algorithms for multithreading compute.



Installation
------------
